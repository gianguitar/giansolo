25 years ago, today, Los Angeles, mainly the San Fernando Valley, was awakened in a brutal manner by a devastating earthquake.

At the end of the shaking, which lasted for 1-3 days, 50 people were killed, the damage ended up costing $35 billion and left 22,000 people displaced
from their homes. Because of the cost in damage, it is simply one of the most expensive natural disasters to ever occur on this
planet and is currently the costliest earthquake in U.S. history. Los Angeles simply looked like a war zone at the end of it with
toppled buildings, no power and deaths across the Southland. 

Now, scientists are warning that there is indeed, a big one waiting in the wings. Their research produces an eye-popping estimate of 
270,000 people displaced and a whopping 1,800 dead if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Los Angeles. The 94' quake was a strong
6.7 magnitude. Imagine that!

My account of things starts with karaoke.

My friends and I, a bunch of us actually, ended up at a friend's house in Sylmar after we left a raging party that was going down 
in Hollywood. My friends owned a huge house in Sylmar and offered extended fun with karaoke and home-cooked food from his mom, whom
he woke up to actually cook for us. We couldn't resist so we headed over.

All was fine and dandy, until it wasn't.

We were partied out. After eating the home-cooked food, we were all about to wind it down and actually head home. So I decided to do 
one more karaoke song before heading out. In the middle of the song, I started to hear and feel a low rumble that was getting louder 
by the second. Upon looking out the window, I noticed lights turning off on the block and then....

BOOM!!!

Lights out. We all fell on the floor or to the adjacent wall. All of my friend's book cases, cabinets, TV, glass casings and other furniture/belongings shattered,
fell, broke or exploded. We bumped into each other, we held onto each other and basically tried to figure out what the hell was happening
because it all came abruptly and very violent. It literally felt like someone picked up the house and shook, like how you would when you 
have a hat full of raffle tickets. Problem was, we were the raffle tickets. I got a cut on my head, bruised on my elbows and whatnot and
the others also had scrapes and such. Everything flew off the shelves, broken glass everywhere and my friend's kitchen wall cracked in half
and fell inot the backyard. It was a complete mess and so were we. By now, some of my friends were crying, some were confused and most
were trying to do something or trying to see whats going on outside cause its dark. We also headed outside cause the smell of gas started to
overwhelm the house and really, the aftershocks were non-stop. As a matter of fact, the aftershocks after the main quake, were very strong and kept on
destroying what it could. The aftershocks were no joke. After helping out a bit to clean up, I decided I needed to be with family so I drove on home.

The drive home is something I'll never forget. I was the lone car on the freeway. All I kept hearing was to stay away from the freeways
and take main roads to get home but I was a teenager so I went on the freeway anyways. The reason why I say it's something I'll never forget
is because of the fact that I have never seen Los Angeles completely in the dark. There were no lights on anywhere. Not on the streets, freeway
, houses or anything. It was darkness, an eerie darkness like the world just ended. Kind of like an episode of the Walking Dead, minnus the 
zombies. It was a sight to see. Darkness, fires, electrical poles on its sides, buckled freeway, buckled sidewalks and sirens everywhere. It felt
so creepy and wrong.

By the time I got home, it's was 6 in the morning. Everyone in the neighborhood is standing outside of their homes with flashlights,
blankets, food, sleeping bags and whatever else to be slightly comfortable. No one wanted to go back into their houses. It literally
took 5-6 hours before people started to go back into their homes. All the while, the aftershocks were rolling constantly and consistently.
I remember taking the fastest shower I've ever done. I was scared shitless of dying in a shower, I'm only human! But really, I was just
glad that my family was safe and sound and that no significant damaged occured in our residence.

The one take away I got from that earthquake was: You can never be ready for an earthquake.

With that said though, you may never be fully prepared for an earthquake but if you have an earthquake kit at the ready or some kind of
bug-out bag, you'd be way more ready than others. In a situation like an earthquake where resources are no use, the kit or bag 
maybe the only form of help you can get for a while. Take it form me, have a kit at the ready. You can thank me later.

I will advice for you to get a kit or earthquake/survival kit from a reputable source nearby. They usually have a kit ready that pertains to
the area you're in, i.e. the desert. If you don't have that luxury, I found some from Amazon that I list below. Again, better to have something 
than nothing when an earthquake occurs.

There are many others that can be found online but these are definitely some kits that you can choose from that would do the trick. 

So where were you when the 94' Northridge earthquake hit? If the big one comes, will you be ready?
