I lost my best friend two weeks ago. I have many amazing friends, but I’ve only had one best friend. 

Mark Cabrera passed away yesterday morning in his sleep. He was found unresponsive by his fiancé after coming back from the grocery store. Our very good friend (brother) Josh, whom lives in the apt., performed CPR until firefighters arrived. Unfortunately, it was too late and Mark was not revived. The cause of death remains unknown. 

It’s extremely difficult to accept this but this is true and unfortunately very real. I am deeply saddened, shocked, and heart broken. I’ve been numb since I got the call and I feel completely fucked up. The sadness that I’m feeling is completely overwhelming. Its very dark right now. 

I’ve known Mark since the 6th grade and we’ve been brothers ever since. I’m glad to say that I got to say goodbye to my best friend before they took him away. I held his hands, said a prayer and told him how much I love him. I cannot properly put into words everything that I’m feeling at this very point but never mind my feelings, this is about Mark. 

My best friend. My brother. He enlightened everyone that he came across. He brought laughter and infected everyone around him with it. He taught me how to take it easy. He taught me how to cook filipino fried rice. He taught me how to party. He taught me that life is to not be taken for granted. He was there every single time to comfort me when I had bad times. He was selfless in the way he helped others. He lived his life the way he wanted to. He adored his family, fiancé, stepson and relatives. He was all about his friends. He was positive, happy and lived free. He was loved and loved by many. He was a real rockstar. 

Words can’t say what life will be like without you my brother, but I’m glad to have been part of your life. It sure has been quite the time and we sure did make memories that I will treasure until it’s my time. 

I Love You my brother, until we hang and jam again, my beautiful friend. RIP.
