<h2>CONSULTATIONS</h2>
  
I'm available to give expert advice, professional direction and actionable instruction to all guitarists and musicians seeking 
direction or clarity in regards to setting and conquering goals, guitar playing in general and musical ambition. With my 
knowledge and real-life experiences, I can definitely and would love to lend a hand or an ear in helping you reach your goals...and have fun while doing it. 
<br /><br />
I sharpened my teeth by playing countless shows at numerous venues all across the country and met the most intuitive musician minds
all along my travels. I became a guitar master because of these experiences. I also ran a rock/metal magazine that gave me the view from
the other side and gave me a different perspective of the music industry, sharpening my teeth further as a professional musician and 
guitar master.
