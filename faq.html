<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Lessons</h3>

<button class="accordion">Why should I take lessons with you?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>For starters, I'm unconventional. I do not dig the normal studies that other teachers offer and have instead taken it upon myself to create a curriculum that suits the needs of eccentric individuals and eager learners. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHAT ARE YOUR RATES?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Rates vary, please inquire through email or text. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">HOW DO I BOOK GIAN TO TEACH ME?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Please head to the contact page and get in touch with Gian.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">HOW LONG ARE THE SESSIONS?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Sessions last anywhere between 30 mins. to 1 hr. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHEN DO YOU TEACH?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Depends on availability of student but I prefer Saturday & Sunday mornings.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHERE ARE THE LESSONS HELD?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I teach in two ways: Skype Lessons or Private Lesson. For Private Lessons, I teach at my home, in my special mancave (garage) wannabe studio. You'll love it! </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">DO YOU OFFER A VIDEO CURRICULUM/LESSON?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Video curriculum/lessons coming soon. Stay tuned! 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">DO YOU DO IN-HOME LESSONS OR GROUP LESSONS?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I prefer to teach in the comfort of my home but I can def. consider different circumstances. Group lessons all good!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WILL I LEARN THE SAME THINGS IF I TAKE SKYPE LESSONS INSTEAD OF IN-PERSON?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If you ask me, it really all depends on how the student wants to learn. We all learn in different ways. Location is also a huge factor in deciding whether the student wants to learn through Skype or in-person. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I HAVE A UNIQUE SCHEDULE. CAN WE WORK AROUND IT?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As I mention above, I am def. willing to consider options. My main concern is the clarity of the lesson. Late nights, no rest, no sleep, or teaching at odd hours is not beneficial for anyone.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHAT IS THE AGE RANGE?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>10 and up. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">DO YOU OFFER GIFT CERTIFICATES?</button>

  <p>1 lesson per week. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">HOW LONG UNTIL I START TO ROCK?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Remember future rock star, Rome was not built overnight. Learning how to play guitar cannot be learned overnight. Practice always and never stop learning. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHAT IS YOUR MUSICAL FOCUS?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I'm a rocker by heart but also focus on pop, metal, folk, punk, funk, soul, oldies, classic rock and much more.</p>
