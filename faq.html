<h3>FAQ</h3>

<h5>Why should I take lessons with you?</h5>
<br />
For starters, I'm unconventional. I did not like the normal studies offered and have instead taken it upon myself to create a curriculum that suits the needs of eccentric individuals and eager learners. 
<br />

<h5>When do you teach?</h5>
<br />

<br />
<h5>Where are the lessons held?</h5>

I teach at my home. In my special mancave (garage) wannabe studio. You'll love it!
<br />
<h5>Do you offer a video curriculum?</h5>
<br />

<br />
<h5>Do you do in-home lessons or group lessons?</h5>
<br />
I prefer to teach in the comfort of my home but I can def. consider different circumstances. Group lessons all good!
<br />
<h5>Will I learn the same things if I take Skype Lessons instead of in-person?</h5>
<br />
If you ask me, it really all depends on how the student wants to learn. We all learn in different ways. Location is also a huge factor in deciding whether the student wants to learn through Skype or in-person.
<br />
<h5>I have a unique schedule. Can we work around it?</h5>
<br />
As I mention above, I am def. willing to consider options. My main concern is the clarity of the lesson. Late nights, no rest, no sleep, or teaching at odd hours is not beneficial for anyone.
<br />
<h5>What is the age range?</h5>
<br />
10 and up.
<br />
<h5>Do you offer gift certificates?</h5>
<br />
Gift Certicates coming soon.
<br />
<h5>How many lessons in a week?</h5>
<br />
1 lesson per week.
<br />
<h5>How long until I start to rock?</h5>
<br />
Remember future rock star, Rome was not built overnight. Learning how to play guitar cannot be learned overnight. Practice always and never stop learning.
<br />
<h5>What is your musical focus?</h5>
