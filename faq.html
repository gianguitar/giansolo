<h2>FAQ/Lesson Policy</h2>

<h3 style="color: #1884BB">LESSONS POLICY</h3>

<button class="accordion">PAYMENT AND PRE-PAYMENTS</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Lessons are sold on a monthly basis. In the 1st session, the student and instructor meet and greet and decide at end of 
    discussions whether its a good fit for both and move forward. All lessons are charged prior to the lesson. Purchased lessons 
    expire 4 months from the date of purchase unless plans have been made with instructor prior to expiration. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">STUDENT PROMISE</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The student will promise to practice at their scheduled practice time and not divert or waiver from the rule. The student is 
  expected to follow and practice correctly and accurately for maximum learning. The proposed practice time is 45 mins. Practice 
  should be 2-4 times a week to maximize learning and see results in less time. Practice is key to learning how to play the guitar 
  progress beyond your wildest guitar dreams so don't pay for lessons if this is not the standard that you are hoping to achive.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">LAST MINUTE SKYPE LESSON, SESSION & CONSULTATION CANCELLATION</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>All Skype lessons, sessions and consultations are subject to a 48-hour cancellation policy. If you cannot make it to your 
  scheduled lesson, session or consultation, you must provide a 48-hour cancellation notice prior or get in contact to reschedule for another time. 
  No notice of cancellation results in a full charge as a no-show fee and services rendered. There are no exceptions to this rule. Being late
  to the lesson also does not guarantee you extra time at the end of your scheduled time, not unless deemed necessary by the instructor.</p>

<h3 style="color: #1884BB">FAQ</h3>

<button class="accordion">Why should I take lessons with you?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>For starters, I'm unconventional. I do not dig the normal studies that other teachers offer and have instead taken it upon myself to create a curriculum that suits the needs of eccentric individuals and eager learners. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHAT ARE YOUR RATES?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Rates vary, please inquire through email or text. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">HOW DO I BOOK GIAN TO TEACH ME?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Please head to the contact page and get in touch with Gian.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">HOW LONG ARE THE SESSIONS?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Sessions last anywhere between 30 mins. to 1 hr. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHEN DO YOU TEACH?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Depends on availability of student but I prefer Saturday & Sunday mornings.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WHERE ARE THE LESSONS HELD?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I teach in two ways: Skype Lessons or Private Lesson. For Private Lessons, I teach at my home, in my special mancave (garage) wannabe studio. You'll love it! </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">DO YOU OFFER A VIDEO CURRICULUM/LESSON?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Video curriculum/lessons coming soon. Stay tuned! 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">DO YOU DO IN-HOME LESSONS OR GROUP LESSONS?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I prefer to teach in the comfort of my home but I can def. consider different circumstances. Group lessons all good!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">WILL I LEARN THE SAME THINGS IF I TAKE SKYPE LESSONS INSTEAD OF IN-PERSON?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If you ask me, it really all depends on how the student wants to learn. We all learn in different ways. Location is also a huge factor in deciding whether the student wants to learn through Skype or in-person. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I HAVE A UNIQUE SCHEDULE. CAN WE WORK AROUND IT?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As I mention above, I am def. willing to consider options. My main concern is the clarity of the lesson. Late nights, no rest, no sleep, or teaching at odd hours is not beneficial for anyone.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>10 and up. </p>

<button class="accordion">HOW LONG UNTIL I START TO ROCK?</button>

<button class="accordion">WHAT IS YOUR MUSICAL FOCUS?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I'm a rocker by heart but also focus on pop, metal, folk, punk, funk, soul, oldies, classic rock and much more.</p>
